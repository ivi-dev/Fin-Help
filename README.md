# Run the app for development
1. Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/) installed. 
2. Clone this repo by running `git clone https://github.com/ivi-dev/Fin-Help.git .` in a terminal/command prompt.
3. `cd` into the newly created directory.
4. Run `python manage.py runserver` in a terminal/command line. That starts up a lightweight local server and makes the site accessible at `http://localhost:8000` through a web browser.

When you're done working on the site hit **Ctrl + C** in the terminal/command line that you used to start the server.
